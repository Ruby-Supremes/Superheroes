## Superheroes Rails Application

## Author : Clement Njeru Â© 2022

 ## Project Description
This is a Superheroes Rails Backend Application that demonstrates the associations between three models: hero, power and hero_power. These models were hence first created which are tables of data with functions that would interact with each other and perform actions in the data using Active Record,

The actions that allowed the database persistency cycle were mainly the CRUD (Create, read, Update and Destroy) actions.

The RESTful application used these HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PATCH) to make requests from the servers, then routes users to a specific resource.
